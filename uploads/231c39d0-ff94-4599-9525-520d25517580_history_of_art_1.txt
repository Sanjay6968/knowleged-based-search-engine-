Title: The Evolution of Art Through the Ages

Art has always been a reflection of human emotion, culture, and intellect. From the earliest cave paintings to modern digital art, it has evolved alongside civilization itself.

1. Prehistoric Art:
   Early humans created cave paintings, carvings, and figurines to depict hunting scenes, animals, and rituals. Famous examples include the Lascaux Caves in France.

2. Ancient Art:
   Civilizations such as Egypt, Greece, and Rome used art to honor gods and rulers. Egyptian art focused on symbolism and afterlife beliefs, while Greek art celebrated beauty and human anatomy.

3. Medieval Art:
   Dominated by religious themes, medieval art included illuminated manuscripts, stained glass windows, and mosaics found in cathedrals. It emphasized spiritual symbolism rather than realism.

4. Renaissance Art:
   This period (14th–17th century) marked a rebirth of humanism and scientific perspective. Artists like Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael combined realism with idealism.

5. Baroque and Rococo:
   Baroque art (17th century) was dramatic and emotional, while Rococo (18th century) emphasized elegance and lightness. Both styles influenced European architecture and painting.

6. Modern Art:
   The 19th and 20th centuries brought movements such as Impressionism, Cubism, Surrealism, and Abstract Expressionism. Artists like Monet, Picasso, and Dalí redefined creativity and perception.

7. Contemporary Art:
   Today, art spans installation, digital, and conceptual forms. It challenges traditional boundaries and explores social, political, and environmental issues.

Art continues to evolve as a powerful medium of expression, blending technology, emotion, and imagination in ways never seen before.
